# Introduction

The National Hockey League (NHL; French: Ligue nationale de hockey—LNH) is a professional ice hockey league in North
America comprising 32 teams—25 in the United States and 7 in Canada. It is considered to be the top ranked professional
ice hockey league in the world, and is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.
The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America,is awarded annually to the league playoff
champion at the end of each season. The NHL is the fifth-wealthiest professional sport league in the world by revenue,
after the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), and
the English Premier League [EPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League)

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to provide a Python API for accessing NHL game data including plays by plays
informations such as game summaries, player stats and play-by-play visualizations. They’re all lots good information
that is hides on NHL API website scraping process regarding the outputs. In this project we are trying to show all NHL
analytics we could like to seek from NHL API. Our package can extract let’s say all most the game summary report as
well as show and finally permit advanced data visualisations.

# Installation

## Setting up Environment

- Git clone the [repository](git@github.com:amandalmia14/hockey-primer-1.git)
- Make sure Python is installed on the system
- Create a virtual environment / conda environment

## Installing Dependencies

- Activate the environment and run `pip install -r requirement.txt` this will download all the dependencies related to
  this project.

## Download Data

- The data for the NHL games are exposed out in the form of various APIs, the details of the APIs can be found over
  [here](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi)
- Run the python script which resides at `modules/data_extraction.py`, this script will fetch the data of the seasons
  starting from 2016 to 2020.

# Project Structure

As seen in the above image, the project is divided into various parts,

- `data` - It contains all the NHL tournament data season wise, in each season we have two json files of regular season
  games and playoffs.
- `modules` - For every action which we are performing in this project, are captured as modules, like data
  extractions, data retrieval (data parsing)
- `notebooks` - For all kinds of visualisations, insights of the data can be accessed through the notebooks.
- `constants.py` - As the name suggests, all the common functions and variables reside in this file.

# Data APIs

In this project as of now we have used two APIs which was provided by NHL,

- `GET_ALL_MATCHES_FOR_A_GIVEN_SEASON = "https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/schedule?season=XXXX"`
    - This API fetch all the matches metadata for a given input season, using this API we are getting the map of
      Matches ID and the type of Match it is like `regular season or playoffs`
- `GET_ALL_DATA_FOR_A_GIVEN_MATCH = "https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/XXXXXXXXXX/feed/live/"`
    - This API fetches all the data in a granular form for a given match id, where we gather the insights subsequently
      in
      the following tasks.
- In order to download a particular data for a season, update the file `modules\dataextraction\data_extraction.py` with
  the `year` variable (one can put multiple seasons to download as well)
- Once the update is done, run `data_extraction.py` it will download the data and place it under a folder with the
  season
  year with two json files, with regular season games and playoffs respectively.

## Data Retrieval

     ```
     TODO
     Discuss how you could add the actual strength information (i.e. 5 on 4, etc.) to both shots and goals, given the 
     other event types (beyond just shots and goals) and features available.
     Ans: 

     In a few sentences, discuss at least 3 additional features you could consider creating from the data available in 
     this dataset. We’re not looking for any particular answers, but if you need some inspiration, could a shot or 
     goal be classified as a rebound/shot off the rush (explain how you’d determine these!)
    
    - We can classify a shot as a rebound shot or not based on the timing on the previous shot. 
    - Based on the given even shot of the player, how likely the shot can be a goal
    - 
    
     ```

<summary>Tidy Data</summary>
<h4>Insights</h4>
There is too much information available from the NHL API at this moment. Not all information are useful, based 
on the project we take the relevant data out from the nested json and create a single tabular structure aka
Dataframe. Below is a glimpse of the tidy data which we had published for further data analysis.
<h3>How to get the number of players in each team</h3>

We would first format a tidy dataframe that includes all types of events, with events as rows and including datetime, eventType,
periodType, penaltySeverity, penaltyMinutes, and team, as columns. The events would to be sorted in order of their occurrence in time during the game (datetime).
We would create an empty (np.nan) column for the number of players on ice, and then program a loop to iterate over all event, while concatenating a list of player counts for each time, n_1 and n_2. At the beginning of the loop, and at the beginning of each period
(each time the period of the event is not the same as the previous event), we re-initiate the parameters: n_1 = 6 (number of players in first team, including the goalie), n_2 = 6 (number of players in second team, including the goalie).
Eight parameters would be set: penalty_player_A_team_1=None, end_time_of_penalty_for_player_A_team_1 = Datetime penalty_player_B_team_1 = None, and end_time_of_penalty_for_player_B_team_1=Datetime (as there can be a maximum of 2 players in penalty at the same time);and the four equivalent parameters for team 2. 
Then, as the loop iterater over all events, each time the eventTypeId == "PENALTY", if "penaltySeverity": "Minor" or "DoubleMinor", the number of player in the team involved in the penalty (Team of the player that is penalized) would be substracted 1, the penalty_player would be set to the name the penalized player, and end_time_of_penalty parameter would be set to DateTime + penaltyMinutes. For subsequent events, as long as the penalty_player is not None, the datetime of the event would be compared to end_time_of_penalty, untill datetime > end_time_of_penalty and then the number of player for that team would be added +1, as the player is back on ice.
Note that for other types of penalty (e.g. misconduct), the number of player on the ice would not be updated as an immediate player replacement is allowed.

<h3>Engineering additionnal features </h3>
We would be interested in studying the impact of tackling and hitting on the chance of goals, both (1) at team-level (2 variables), (2) player-level (4 variables), and (3) total through the game (4 variables). Indeed, tackling and hitting has become an important part of hockey, often discussed by commentators, and highly represented in the data under "eventTypeId": "HIT". 
(1) We would first extract, for each shot event, variables at team-level that corresponds to the time (in minutes) between the shot and the last time a player of the team on which the shot was taken was hit. This would be done by iterating through all events in chronological order, initiating the time at as NaN at the beginning of each period, and updating the time at each time a hit happens, for each team. This would result in variables: time_since_last_hit_team_1 and time_since_last_hit_team_2. 
(2) Additionally, during the same iteration process, we would update four boolean variables with player-level information to note whether the hitter and the hittee from the last hit event were among the player involved in the shot (shooter, goalie or assist). This would result in variables: hitter_involved_team_1, hittee_involved_team_1, hitter_involved_team_2, hittee_involved_team_2. 
(3) Finally, to study the relationship between goals and the total number of hits in a game, we would extract 4 variables, during the same iteration process as above. These variables would be initiated at 0 at the beginning of the game, and updated at each hit event for each team and type of player involved (hitter or hittee). This would result in variables: n_hitter_team_1, n_hittee_team_1, n_hitter_team_2, n_hittee_team_2.

<summary>Goals By Season for the season 2016-2018-2019-2020</summary>
     <h4>Insights</h4>
     The most dangerous types of shots for this 2016-2017 season are “deflected” (19.8% of success) followed by 
     “tip-in” shots (17.9% of success). By “most dangerous”, we mean that these shots are the ones that end up the most 
     frequently by a successful goal, as opposed to being missed. However, these are among the less frequent ones: 
     there were only 806 “deflected” and 3,267 “tip-in” shots this season. On the contrary, the most common type of 
     shots was by far the “wrist shot”, with a total of 38,056 shots of that type for this season.
     <br>
     <br>
     We chose to illustrate this question with a barplot while overlaying the count of goals in blue overtop the total 
     count of shots in orange (thus, total of both goals and other, missed shots), by type of shot. Even though there 
     is a large difference between the most common and less common types of shots, we chose to plot the absolute numbers
     and to keep the scale linear, because these are the most intuitive for the reader to understand the scale 
     (the great number of goals involved in a same season) and not to be confused with too many percentages on the same 
     figure. We chose to add annotations on top of bars for the percentage of goals over all shots, because 
     these proportions could not be visually abstracted simply from the figure, and this was an intuitive way to 
     illustrate them.
     <img src="/assets/figures/figure_1_goals_by_shot_type_2016.png"/>

     The proportion of goals over all shots increases overall exponentially as the distance diminishes, with a
     maximum proportion of goals >25% when goals are shot at less than 5 feet from the goal. We also note a small,
     local maximum at 75 to 80 feet. This distribution did not increase significantly for seasons 2018-19 to 2020-21. This local
     maximum could suggest that there is another variable (e.g. shot type or other) that could underlie this
     distribution.
     <br>
     <br>
     We chose this figure after having considered and visualized different types of figures. First, we visualized
     violin plots of the distribution of goals and missed shots; however, these did not intuitively represent the chance
     (proportion) of goals over all shots per se, and the result was dependent on some assumption on the kernel size.
     We also experimented computing a logistic regression to predict goals from the distance category, which worked fine.
     <br>
     <br>
     Finally, we chose to come back to the most simple and intuitive method, which is to bin the distance into categories,
     and plot the proportion of goals for each bin. We chose to divide the distance into equal bins (as opposed to
     percentiles or other kind of distribution), in order to be able to draw direct conclusion about the relationship of
     goals to the absolute value of distance by visualizing the figure.


     Overall, the most dangerous type of shot is the “tip-in” shot taken at a distance of less than 5 feet, followed
     closely by “back-hand” shots: more than 40% of these shots result in a goal. The relationship found in the
     previous questions, i.e. that the probability of a goal augments exponentially as the distance decreases,
     holds true overall for most types of shots. However, the “deflected” and “tip-in” shots have a second maximum
     between around 30 and 60 feet.
     <br>
     <br>
     Importantly, the “back-hand” shot has a second maximum at about 80 feet, and the slap-shot has a second maximum
     at more than 90 feet. This could explain the small local maximum at that distance that we observed in the global
     distribution of all shots at the previous figure.
     <br>
     <br>
     Finally, the curves are somewhat irregular, and adding more data (e.g. averaging through a few years) could add more
     smoothness in the results. Note that to have more smoothed curves and remove outliers, we did not plot the points for
     which we had less than 10 total observations for that type of shot and at that distance in that season.

## Advance Visualisations and Interactive figures

Here, we compute the average shot rate per hour for each team and for each location on the ice, rounded to a square foot, as compared to the league average shot rate per hour for that same location in years 2016 to 2020, and normalized by the latter. Formally, we compute: 

((team average shot rate per hour for location k) - (league average shot rate per hour for location k))/ (team average shot rate per hour for location k)

We then display the result for each square foot on the ice, as a heatmap overlayed on a figure of the hockey rink, for the offensive zone. The heatmap was smoothed using a gaussian filter with sigma=5. We plot independent figures the years 2016-17, 2018-2019, 2019-20 and 2020-21, with option to choose the team to display.

Discuss the interpretation of the figures

These figures display the excess shot rate per hour by ice location for the team and year, normalized by the league average for all teams and years (2016 to 2020). The excess shot rate is displayed as a proportion of the league average; it is important to look as the scale from the side colorbar before comparing the teams, because we chose to re-adjust the colorbar scale for each team for a better visualization. 

The visualization of these figures can help understand in which locations each team was more active in taking shoots as compared to the usual level of shot activity in that zone. This can reflect in part the strategy taken by the team during that season. This strategy could also be correlated with the success of that team during that season.  

We consulted the complete league standings on the NHL webside (https://www.nhl.com/standings/2016/league). We note that the Colorado Avalanche was ranked as the last team in the league for the 2016-2017 season, with as few as 48 points total. On the contrary, the Colorado Avalanche was ranked as first of the league for the 2020-2021, with 82 points total and winning the Stanley Cup. This does not directly reflect in the shot maps, since the shot map displays all shots, not only goals. For the 2016-2017 season, the shot map shows that the Colorado Avalanche were doing many shots in excess (up to 120% of the league average for some locations on the ice), specifically in the neutral zone face-off spots (especially left side), and also from the boards behind the goalie. This suggests that shooting from these areas was not successful in achieving goals.  On the contrary, for the 2020-2021 year, the shot map of the Colorado Avalanche shows a shot rate per hour overall closer to the team average, except that an excess of shots were taken from the zone near the referee crease (left side on the plot). This suggests that shooting from that area might have been a good strategy to achieve goals. However, these hypotheses would need to be confirmed in further work that could draw for example shot maps only for the shots that were successful in achieving goals.

Here, we compare the Buffalo Sabres and the Tampa Bay Lightning, while considering that the latter ranked first (for total points) in 2018-2019 and won the Stanley Cup both for 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons. As a comparison, the Buffalo Sabres has been struggling and ranked 27th, 25th and 31th (for total points) for those three years. We thus compare the shot maps of teams for these three years. 

The patterns reflected by shot maps for these years shows a clear difference, when focusing on the locations from where the shots were taken. We note that while the Tampa Bay Lightning has taken an excess of shots of the attacking zone (2018-19, and 2019-2020 seasons), and also from the boards just behind the goalie (2019-2020 and 2020-2021 season). On the contrary, the Buffalo Sabres were taking a number of shots close to the league average, and the only areas in which they were taking excesses of shots were further from the goal, for example, they were taking shots from near the referee crease or from close to the ice center. 

These comparisons suggest that some teams (here, the Tampa Bay Lightning) are more successful in winning when taking more shots from the attacking zone or from the boards behind the goalie, than other teams (here, the Buffalo Sabres) that took shots from further on the ice. Overall, it suggests that not only the excess of shots by itself, but the location of these shots, has an impact on the performance of the team. 

However, this does not give the complete picture. First, all the comparisons done here were done visually, that is, we did not conduct statistical testing nor predictive modelling assessments. Second, we considered only the excess shot rate per hour stratified by all locations on the ice, not whether these shots actually resulted in goals. This does not give us information on the proportion of each shot that achieved goals in each location. For example, we see that the Buffalo Sabres were taking many shots from a furthest distance, and this is associated with the fact that this team did poorly in that season, but we did not directly assess the mechanism involved in the relationship between the shots in question and their unsuccessful results. Finally, it is possible that some locations of shooting do not directly result in goals, but have a broader impact on the game, by either making later goals possible for the team involved or making this team vulnerable to shots by the other team.  Overall, these limitations highlight the necessity to be very careful when making causality or mechanistic assumptions from solely the visualization of data.

## How we downloaded the dataset
In the beginning we start from the unofficial website so we figured out we have to know what does mean the ten digits number XXXXXXXXXX that we need to choose as GAME_ID
We analyze them and understand that


the first 4 digits identify the season for example 2016 for the 2016-2017 season. The next 2 digits gives the type of game
- 01 = preseason
-  02 = regular season
-  03 = playoffs
-  04 = all-star
The final 4 digits identify the specific game number as follow 
- regular season and preseason games
- playoff games, the 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of the playoffs, 
-3rd digit specifies the matchup, and 
-4th digit specifies the game (out of 7).
after that we try to figure it out the structure of the NHL database.
so we look in to some small parts and save in Jason file and try to see what actually we can do how we can sparssing data in python .
we see that we have to work on this Jason file to be able to access to the details 
we tried recursion function to go to nested dictionary in the Jason file but we had som problem about to passing all informations.
